# PoeSmoother - Path of Exile effects remover -> credits to the makers of VisualGGPK

This tool is using VisualGGPK (many thank's to creators) to disable unwanted effects from the game.


- Completely removes all particles.
- Removes particle effects from skills.
- Lower ground effects particles.
- Removes sound effects for Spectre, Golems, Chars, Portals, Waypoints.
- Change ItemFilter sounds with any other sound.
- Completely removes Extra Gore from uniques items.
- Custom options for all types of effects.
- Brings back the girls on globes.


Usage:

- simple as it is, just check what you want to disable and it's done.
The is an info_path.txt file with paths of what is changed for easy track of any errors.

Any helpers/contributors good at programming are very welcomed. 
My limited skills on c#, makes the tool to look like a mess, but it's working as intended :)


***Concerning of being banned by GGG,...disabling effects that are causing a super computer to lag and playing with headaches...i don't think GGG have that low self respect to ban any of VisualGGPK users, and never heard of someone being banned for that anyway (but who knows..nothing is 100% sure).***


enjoy,
