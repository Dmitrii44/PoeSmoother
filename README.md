# PoeSmoother - Path of Exile effects remover -> credits to the makers of VisualGGPK

 * This tool is using VisualGGPK (many thank's to creators) to disable unwanted effects from the game.
 
 - Completely removes rain particles.
 - Removes particle effects from skills (just one for now - herald of ice).
 - Removes sound effects for Spectre, Golems, Chars, Portals, Waypoints.
 
 - possibility to add more if users are asking for.
 
  ...working in progress
  
  * Usage : 
  - simple as it is, just check what you want to disable and it's done.
  The is an info_path.txt file with paths of what is changed for easy track of any errors.
 

 
 Any helpers/contributors good at programming are very welcomed. 
 My limited skills on c#, makes the tool to look like a mess, but it's working as intended :)
 
 *** Concerning of being banned by GGG,...disabling effects that are causing my super computer to lag and playing with headaches...i don't think GGG have that low self respect to ban any of VisualGGPK users, and never heard of someone being banned for that anyway (but who knows..nothing is 100% sure).
 
 
 enjoy,
